# CORAL S-OPE Configuration Development Archive

This directory contains the development history of CORAL's S-OPE (Specialized-Operations Processing Engine) configuration, documenting the evolution of the multi-agent system architecture from its initial conception to the stable configuration used in our research paper.

## Development Timeline

### Initial Version (circa January 2025)
**Status:** No archived version available
- **Rules:** 1 rule, 3,401 characters
- **File:** `coding.mdc` (predecessor of current `03_b_writer.mdc` and `03_c_coder.mdc`)
- **Features:** Basic coding functionality

### Version 2025-04-16
**Directory:** `created_250416/`
- **Rules:** 2 rules, total 6,454 characters
- **Files:**
  - `strategy.mdc` (predecessor of current `00_sensemaker`)
  - `coding.mdc`
- **New Features:**
  - Added dialogue functionality
  - Simultaneous application of multiple custom instructions
  - `strategy.mdc` applied constantly with `coding.mdc` added as needed

### Version 2025-04-27
**Directory:** `created_250427/`
- **Rules:** 4 rules, total 11,954 characters
- **Files:**
  - `orchestrator.mdc` (predecessor of current `01_orchestrator.mdc`)
  - `strategy.mdc`
  - `coding.mdc`
  - `linting.mdc` (predecessor of current `03_d_runner.mdc`)
- **New Features:**
  - Added orchestration functionality
  - Dynamic switching between multiple custom instructions
  - Cell-like design but without TIDE (context inheritance) concept

### Version 2025-04-28
**Directory:** `created_250428/`
- **Rules:** 3 rules, total 14,745 characters + configuration files
- **Files:**
  - `orchestrator.mdc`
  - `planner.mdc` (predecessor of current `02_planner.mdc`)
  - `execute.mdc` (integrated predecessor of current `03_a_task_manager`, `03_b_writer`, `03_c_coder`, `03_d_runner`)
  - Configuration files in `styleguide/`
- **New Features:**
  - Added planning functionality
  - Attempted file reduction and integration
  - Converted `strategy.mdc` to static configuration file applied to all custom instructions
  - Unified Executor Cells into single file
- **Issues:** These changes reduced system stability
- **Architecture:** Cell-like design but still without TIDE concept

### Version 2025-05-09
**Directory:** `created_250509/`
- **Rules:** 7 rules, total 36,223 characters + configuration files
- **Files:**
  - `00_sensemaker.mdc`
  - `01_orchestrator.mdc`
  - `02_planner.mdc`
  - `03_a_executor_planned.mdc`
  - `03_b_executor_coding.mdc`
  - `03_c_executor_markdownedit.mdc`
  - `03_d_executor_terminal.mdc`
  - Configuration files in `configs/`
- **Architecture:** Nearly identical to current configuration (with different naming/ordering)
- **New Features:**
  - Re-divided Executor Cells for better modularity
  - Redefined sensemaker as dialogue cell
  - **First appearance of TIDE** (context inheritance concept)
  - Inheritance context's 6 perspectives not yet defined

### Version 2025-06-11 (Final Evaluated Version)
**Status:** Not archived (current active configuration)
- **Rules:** 7 rules, total 38,224 characters + configuration files
- **Features:**
  - Complete Cell, TIDE, and inheritance context framework
  - Version used for quantitative evaluation in research paper
  - Stable configuration with all 6 inheritance context perspectives defined

## Key Evolution Patterns

1. **Increasing Complexity:** From 1 rule (3.4K chars) to 7 rules (38.4K chars)
2. **Architectural Refinement:** 
   - Simple coding → Cell-based architecture
   - Static application → Dynamic switching → Context inheritance (TIDE)
3. **Modularization Attempts:** 
   - Integration phase (2025-04-28) reduced stability
   - Re-division (2025-05-09) restored modularity and stability
4. **Core Concept Development:**
   - Dialogue functionality (2025-04-16)
   - Orchestration (2025-04-27)
   - Planning (2025-04-28)
   - TIDE (2025-05-09)
   - Context Inheritance → CORAL framework (2025-06-05)




## Research Context

This archive serves as supporting material for the CORAL S-OPE research paper, demonstrating the iterative development process that led to the final stable multi-agent configuration. The evolution shows the importance of modular design and context inheritance in multi-agent AI systems.

## File Structure Notes

- `.mdc` files contain custom instruction definitions for the multi-agent system
- Configuration directories contain supporting parameter files
- Each version directory represents a snapshot of the complete system at that point in development
