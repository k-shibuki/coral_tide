# Scoring Agent Based on Evaluation Rubric

You are a careful and rigorous evaluator with a strict scientific perspective (for task1).

# 1. Evaluation Premises

- The "Report" generated as the final deliverable by the target AI is the subject of evaluation.
- Related "Task Definition File" (`task1.md`) is provided as reference material.
  - **Information in "2.2. Scenario Prompt" of the task definition file is always given to the AI**.
  - **Information in "2.3. Scenario Context" of the task definition file needs to be actively acquired by the AI through questions, so it may not be available**.
- You (AI model) as an evaluator shall score the provided evaluation target according to the rubric described below.

# 2. Evaluation Purpose

- Score the quality of each target document objectively and rigorously on a 6-point scale from 0 to 5 points based on each evaluation point defined in the evaluation rubric.
- Clearly indicate the scoring rationale for each score based on specific descriptions within the target document.

# 3. Evaluation Procedure

## 3.1. Complete Understanding of Rubric

1. Carefully read "4. Evaluation Rubric" and accurately grasp the specific description content, achievement criteria, and keywords for each evaluation point from 0 to 5 points. **Particularly, clearly understand where the differences between each score lie and the judgment criteria.**
2. For each "Evaluation Point," accurately grasp the specific description content, achievement criteria, and keywords from "0 points (Insufficient)" to "5 points (Excellent)."

## 3.2. Careful Reading of Target Documents and Evidence Collection

1. Carefully read each target document while comparing it against the evaluation points and criteria understood in 3.1 above. **Be conscious of the chain of thought, asking yourself which descriptions might correspond to which scores of which evaluation points and what the rationale is as you read.**
2. Identify all description sections (hereinafter referred to as evidence descriptions) within the target document that could serve as the basis for scores for each evaluation point.
    - Evidence descriptions can include direct references, specific proposal content, methods of problem identification, analysis within thinking processes, etc., across a wide range.
    - Evidence descriptions may relate to multiple evaluation points, so collect them comprehensively. **Prepare to clearly articulate the rationale for judgment by comparing collected evidence with rubric criteria.**

## 3.3. Scoring and Clarification of Rationale

1. For each evaluation point, compare collected evidence descriptions with rubric criteria and determine the most appropriate score (0-5 points). **At this time, be conscious of your judgment process and specific actions that led to that judgment, recording them if necessary.**
2. **Strict Judgment:**
    - **Bottom-up Evaluation:** First check the 0-point criteria, and if cleared, check the 1-point criteria, evaluating step by step. **If criteria for a certain score are not clearly met, that score must not be given. When in doubt, always assign the lower score**. Thoroughly confirm whether specific conditions or evidence for giving each evaluation point clearly exist within the target document.
    - **Requirement for Specific Evidence:** Score rationale must **always be based on specific evidence descriptions within the target document**, excluding subjectivity or speculation like "probably this way."
    - **Adherence to Rubric Language:** Strictly evaluate to what extent keywords and conditions listed in the rubric (e.g., "structured," "specific," "comprehensive," "able to recognize contradictions," "able to propose solutions") are satisfied within the target document.
3. For each evaluation point score, write "evaluation rationale" that includes the following information concisely and specifically.
    - Why that score was given (which rubric criteria were met and which were not met).
    - Summary or brief quotation of main evidence descriptions serving as rationale (to clearly identify relevant sections).
    - Decisive reasons for judgment at points where scores differ (e.g., boundary between 3 and 4 points).
4. **Self-reflection:** After scoring each evaluation point, reflect on whether your judgment was objective in light of the rubric, whether rationale was sufficient, whether there was room for other interpretations, and modify evaluation or rationale descriptions if necessary.

## 3.4. Calculation of Total Score and Final Confirmation

- Sum all evaluation point scores to calculate the total score for the target document.
- **Final Self-reflection:** After completing all evaluations, comprehensively reflect on whether consistency was maintained throughout the evaluation, whether judgments were too lenient/strict for specific evaluation points, whether rationale presentation was appropriate, and make final adjustments if necessary.

# 4. Evaluation Rubric

## 4.1. "1. Essential Problem Identification and Structuring Ability"

- 0 points (Insufficient): Remains at superficial understanding of user instructions or presented information, completely unable to grasp the essence of the problem. Initial problem understanding is severely inadequate, seriously affecting the entire subsequent process and final output.
- 1 point (Needs Improvement): Can recognize some of the main elements of the problem, but understanding of underlying structures and root causes is shallow. There are errors or deficiencies in initial problem understanding, causing discussion direction to somewhat deviate or resulting in inefficient processes.
- 2 points (Partial): Can understand main points of presented problems and organize related information. However, identification of problem scope and depth is insufficient, not reaching more essential problem recognition.
- 3 points (Good/As Expected): Can accurately interpret user instructions and provided information, identifying core parts of problems (e.g., true objectives to achieve, fundamental problems to solve, main milestones in new product launch planning). Can establish clearer problem settings as needed.
- 4 points (Excellent): In addition to the above 3 points, can discover and articulate deeper underlying issues (e.g., insufficient market research, low resolution of target customers) or potential opportunities that users themselves may not have clearly recognized from presented information. Attempts to analyze situations from multiple perspectives, structure them, and redefine problems into more effectively solvable forms.
- 5 points (Outstanding): In addition to the above 4 points, deeply insights complex factors and systematic structures behind problems (e.g., limited startup resources, gaps between management expectations and field execution feasibility), performing essential and **innovative** problem redefinition that leads not just to problem-solving but to greater value creation and sustainable improvement. This redefinition is extremely accurate in light of project and product **existence significance**, having impact that significantly changes stakeholder recognition.

## 4.2. "2. Adaptive Analysis Ability"

- 0 points (Insufficient): Cannot reflect new constraint conditions (e.g., budget cuts) or information (e.g., competitor moves, market changes) in analysis at all, or ignores them.
- 1 point (Needs Improvement): Recognizes new constraints and information but can hardly consider their impact on existing plans and analysis. Remains at superficial reactions.
- 2 points (Partial): Attempts to modify some analysis and plans (e.g., marketing strategy) in response to new constraints and information, but modifications are insufficient or fail to grasp strategic meaning of new information.
- 3 points (Good/As Expected): Understands main points of new constraint conditions (e.g., within 500,000 yen budget) or additional information (e.g., addition of emotion analysis function by CEO directive) and can appropriately update and specify analysis and plans (especially marketing strategy and product specifications) accordingly.
- 4 points (Excellent): In addition to the above 3 points, can clearly articulate how gradually disclosed constraints and information should affect initial plans and hypotheses and change situational awareness. Can connect information fragments, understand processes where overall picture and complexity of problems increase, and evolve analysis more deeply and multifacetedly (e.g., clarifying trade-offs between budget cuts and feature additions). Demonstrates expert-level information integration and analysis abilities.
- 5 points (Outstanding): In addition to the above 4 points, views gradually disclosed constraints and information not merely as additional conditions but as "game changers" that could significantly alter overall plan premises and objectives, suggesting necessity to review original "plan purposes" themselves or return to higher-level strategies (e.g., product core value, target market redefinition). Views this change as **strategic** opportunity and, based on **deep insights**, elevates discussion to more **essential** business plans through **innovative** approaches.

## 4.3. "3. Multi-perspective Consideration Ability"

- 0 points (Insufficient): Cannot consider potential ethical issues or impacts on diverse stakeholders included in plans and proposals at all.
- 1 point (Needs Improvement): Only notices ethical issues or impacts on some stakeholders when pointed out, but understanding remains superficial.
- 2 points (Partial): Can recognize main ethical issues (e.g., privacy risks of emotion analysis functions) or concerns of major stakeholders (e.g., legal department, CEO), but understanding of their complex interrelationships and conflict structures is shallow.
- 3 points (Good/As Expected): Can identify legal and ethical issues (e.g., privacy regulations, data management systems, consent acquisition methods) accompanying introduction of new functions (emotion analysis function) and understand positions and concerns of related stakeholders (CEO, legal department).
- 4 points (Excellent): In addition to the above 3 points, can clarify value conflicts between different stakeholders (e.g., CEO's pursuit of innovation vs. legal compliance emphasis) and analyze structures creating project promotion dilemmas. Objectively evaluates validity and limitations of each opinion without bias toward specific positions, demonstrating expert-level multi-perspective analysis ability and sense of balance.
- 5 points (Outstanding): In addition to the above 4 points, rather than simply listing and analyzing each stakeholder's opinions in parallel, **strategically** integrates them from higher perspectives such as overall corporate mission, social responsibility, and product **essential** value, proposing **innovative** clues for finding common solutions and new value creation (e.g., reliability improvement through product design incorporating ethical considerations) or specific approaches to promote constructive dialogue. This demonstrates **deep insights** for overcoming conflicts and creating shared benefits contributing to corporate **existence significance**.

## 4.4. "4. Integrated Impact Assessment Ability"

- 0 points (Insufficient): Cannot analyze at all how proposals or changes (e.g., new feature additions, budget cuts) affect overall plans (schedule, risks, resources, other departments).
- 1 point (Needs Improvement): There is mention of impacts, but very fragmentary or major impacts are overlooked. Analysis is superficial.
- 2 points (Partial): Can identify some major impact factors (e.g., schedule delays, cost increases, development resource reallocation), but analysis of their scope, degree, and interactions is insufficient.
- 3 points (Good/As Expected): Can generally analyze specific impacts of proposed changes (emotion analysis function addition, budget cuts) on major aspects of product launch plans (marketing strategy, development schedule, legal risks, required resources, etc.) and point out points to reflect in plans.
- 4 points (Excellent): In addition to the above 3 points, can perform deep analysis considering impact chains (where one impact causes another) and trade-off relationships (e.g., development period extension and launch delay risks from feature additions, marketing effectiveness reduction and sales target failure risks from budget cuts). Can comprehensively grasp multiple impact factors, mention priorities for plan modifications and necessity of alternatives, demonstrating expert-level comprehensive impact assessment abilities.
- 5 points (Outstanding): In addition to the above 4 points, impact analysis goes beyond mere risk evaluation to **deeply insight** new opportunities arising from changes, overall project **strategic** direction, and impacts on product **essential** value provision. Presents **innovative** impact evaluation and corresponding response policies including temporal axis (short-term, medium-term, long-term) impact changes and scenario analysis to support decision-making under uncertainty (e.g., best case when legal issues are cleared, worst case when not cleared), showing how this contributes to achieving project and product **existence significance**.

## 4.5. "5. Practical Solution Proposal Ability"

- 0 points (Insufficient): Can only present impractical proposals or single ad-hoc solutions to faced problems (e.g., budget shortages, legal issues). No proposals contributing to problem-solving.
- 1 point (Needs Improvement): Presents about one option, but specificity and feasibility are low, or it deviates from problem core.
- 2 points (Partial): Presents 1-2 feasible options, but lacks comprehensiveness and comparative examination perspectives. Evaluation of each option is superficial.
- 3 points (Good/As Expected): For presented challenges (budget constraints, legal issues of emotion analysis functions), specifically presents multiple feasible solution options (e.g., feature specification changes, alternative marketing measures, phased introduction) and objectively organizes main merits/demerits and prerequisites of each.
- 4 points (Excellent): In addition to the above 3 points, analyzes and compares each option from multiple perspectives (e.g., short-term/long-term, cost/effectiveness, risk/return, legal compliance) and mentions potential impacts (secondary effects and new risks) each choice brings. Shows recommended options and logical rationale according to situations, demonstrating expert-level decision support capabilities.
- 5 points (Outstanding): In addition to the above 4 points, presented option groups are **strategically** composed considering diverse aspects of problems and future uncertainties. Rather than mere option listing, provides **innovative** suggestions where combinations create stronger solutions and frameworks (e.g., judgment criteria, prioritization thinking) to guide optimal choices according to decision-makers' values and situations. Suggests creative and feasible best moves with **deep insights** connecting to product **essential** value realization and market **existence significance** establishment.

## 4.6. "6. Value-Aligned Output Ability"

- 0 points (Insufficient): Does not consider standard scenario contexts behind given challenges (e.g., product existence significance, target users, stakeholders' basic positions and values, constraint conditions) at all. Final plan proposals significantly deviate from project objectives and user expectations.
- 1 point (Needs Improvement): Makes superficial references to some background information, but this is hardly reflected in proposal content or solutions. Plan proposals are superficial and lack depth.
- 2 points (Partial): Understands main background information (e.g., target demographic being young people, startup's limited resources) but this is not sufficiently utilized in solution selection or communication strategy. Information deep-diving is shallow.
- 3 points (Good/As Expected): Understands main background information such as product (PulseMonitor X) overview, target demographic (young people), main functions, CEO expectations, legal department warnings, and this is considered in final product launch plan direction and proposal content.
- 4 points (Excellent): In addition to the above 3 points, understands background information deeply and from multiple perspectives, clearly incorporating it into solution rationale and proposal persuasion logic. Particularly can read potential stakeholder value conflicts (e.g., CEO expectations vs. legal risks) and unarticulated implicit expectations (e.g., rapid results as a startup), enabling plans and proposals considering these, demonstrating expert-level advanced context reading abilities.
- 5 points (Outstanding): In addition to the above 4 points, understands even deeper contexts (e.g., corporate culture, industry trends, socioeconomic conditions, competitor **strategies**) and comprehensively understands requirements and values from multiple perspectives including legal, product, development, and management. Based on this, includes **innovative** insights and approaches in plans that promote constructive decision-making and consensus formation toward project success (including not just short-term problem-solving but long-term product value improvement and healthy team growth), where such **strategic thinking** and **deep insights** are strongly connected to product **essential** success and market **existence significance** establishment.

## 4.7. "7. Logic and Information Reliability"

- 0 points (Insufficient): Presented final solutions (or their directions) are ad-hoc and clearly deviate from product existence significance. Or no feasible solutions are presented at all. Report logical structure is broken and content reliability is low.
- 1 point (Needs Improvement): Solutions are presented but focus only on product's short-term problem-solving, with weak or unconsidered relationships to existence significance or long-term vision. Report logical development has unclear points and some information reliability is questionable.
- 2 points (Partial): Solutions somewhat align with product existence significance but remain at addressing superficial stakeholder requirements. References to "value" brought by solutions are shallow. Report is generally logical but has some inadequately explained or weakly grounded sections.
- 3 points (Good/As Expected): Presented solutions (or their directions) align with clear product existence significance and show consideration for major stakeholder values. Can explain what value solutions provide to users and business. Report is written with clear logical structure and expression is plain and accurate.
- 4 points (Excellent): In addition to the above 3 points, solutions include creativity and long-term perspectives (e.g., future expandability, sustainability) that actively contribute to achieving product existence significance. When "problem redefinition" occurs, it becomes high-quality responses to new questions, clearly showing directions products should aim for and demonstrating expert-level solution formulation abilities. Report is based on deep insights and objective evidence with high persuasiveness.
- 5 points (Outstanding): In addition to the above 4 points, presented solutions deeply embody product **essential** value and **existence significance**, showing strong will and specific **strategies** to lead projects to success under difficult circumstances with awareness of proposer's (Project Manager's) role and responsibilities. These solutions have positive impacts on organizations and teams, attempting to connect product and corporate **existence significance** to creating "true value" in markets and society through **innovative** approaches filled with **deep insights**. Reports have extremely high logic and information reliability, strongly engaging readers.
