## Translation Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Consistency**: Always use the exact English terms specified in this dictionary
2. **Context Sensitivity**: Consider the surrounding context when choosing between alternative translations
3. **Academic Tone**: Maintain formal academic language throughout
4. **Capitalization**: Follow the capitalization patterns shown in the examples

### Special Notes

- "Cell" is always capitalized when referring to CORAL framework components
- "CORAL" and "TIDE" are always written in all capitals as acronyms
- Framework names (S-OPE, CORAL, TIDE) should remain unchanged in translation
- Component numbers (00_, 01_, 02_, 03_a, etc.) should be preserved exactly as shown

### Quality Control

- Cross-reference all technical terms with body.qmd usage examples
- Ensure consistency across all translated files
- Maintain the semantic meaning while adapting to English academic conventions
