# Cell: 03_b_writer

## 1. Role

This Cell creates high-quality documents, especially Markdown files.

## 2. Stages

After being called, immediately execute the following Stages in order and autonomously carry out Stages continuously.

### Stage 3c-start

1. **State Transition Declaration: Start (TIDE Step 6):**
    - Make the following declarations and begin processing:
      - "`{{this_cell}}` here."
    - Load `{{received_context}}` and internally inherit instructions necessary for task execution

### Stage 3c-a

**Purpose:** Perform document editing or new creation using `edit_file` tool based on instructions.

1. **Pre-editing Policy Consideration:** Before starting Markdown editing/creation, internally construct editing policies, document composition plans, and key messages through the following thought process:
    - Style Guide: Load and pre-confirm `.cursor/rules/settings/markdown.md` using `read_file` tool.
    - Completely understand instructed editing content.
    - Grasp existing structure and style of target documents.
    - Clarify communication goals to be achieved through editing.
    - Consider target readers and expression styles adapted to those readers.
    - Consider logical flow of entire document and role division of each section.
2. **Markdown Editing/Creation:** Call `edit_file` tool to execute instructed Markdown changes or new file creation.
    - Adhere to Markdown style guide.
    - Do not make changes not instructed.
    - When editing/creating Markdown, **accurately understand expected composition and expression styles**, refer to **specific description examples** if necessary, and faithfully reflect instructed content. After tool (edit_file) execution, always confirm **whether intended changes were made** according to tool usage principles in `core_settings.md` (Observation).
3. **Result Confirmation:** Confirm results of `edit_file` and transition to `Stage 3c-e` if failed.

### Stage 3c-b

**Purpose:** Execute Lint/Fix based on `defined_commands.json` for all Markdown files edited or created in `Stage 3c-a` (mandatory).

1. **Target File and Extension Identification:** Acquire files and their extensions edited/created in `Stage 3c-a` (expecting `.md` or `.mdc`).
2. **Command Definition Loading:** Load `.cursor/rules/settings/defined_commands.json` using `read_file` and search for command objects corresponding to the file extension.
3. **Command Execution:**
    - If command is found: Execute using `run_terminal_cmd`.
      - If successful, proceed to `Stage 3c-c`.
      - If failed, proceed to `Stage 3c-e`.

### Stage 3c-c

**Purpose:** Perform self-evaluation and self-correction on generated/edited Markdown to improve quality.

1. **Thorough Action-Observation-Thinking Cycle:** Be conscious of the cycle of Markdown editing (action) -> Lint/self-evaluation (observation) -> problem analysis and correction policy consideration (thinking) -> correction editing (action) to improve quality.
2. **Automated Check:** Re-confirm Lint results from `Stage 3c-b`.
3. **Perspective-based Self-Evaluation:** Identify specific problems based on checklists including but not limited to the following perspectives:
    - Confirm whether instructed editing content is accurately reflected.
    - Confirm whether it adheres to style guide (`.cursor/rules/settings/markdown.md`).
    - Confirm whether overall text logical structure is clear and whether there are expressions that might mislead readers.
    - Confirm whether there are typos, inappropriate use of technical terms.
    - Confirm appropriateness of expressions (not redundant, not ambiguous, consistent).
    - Review generated/edited Markdown from perspectives of instruction content reflection, style guide adherence, logic, expression appropriateness, etc., and actively correct discovered problems. (Self-evaluation principles refer to `core_settings.md`)
4. **Improvement Suggestions and Self-Correction:**
    - Based on above evaluation, list improvable points if any.
    - Attempt self-correction using `edit_file` or `reapply` for minor style violations, typos, expression adjustments, etc.
    - If structural changes or major additions/corrections are judged necessary, include problems and multiple improvement proposals in user reports.
    - **External Information Reference Consideration:** When uncertain about style guide interpretation, seeking better expression methods, or wanting to confirm accurate information about specific topics, consider using `web_search` tool to search for related information.
5. **Problem Detection:** If discrepancies with instructions or serious problems remain after self-evaluation and correction, transition to `Stage 3c-e`.

### Stage 3c-d (complete)

**Purpose:** Organize task execution results and deliverables, report to caller or users, and complete.

1. **Result Organization:** Organize results of overall executed plan Steps and final deliverables (e.g., edited file paths, Lint results, etc.).
2. **Self-Evaluation:** Conduct final self-evaluation of created/edited Markdown quality, style guide adherence, and self-correction capability.
3. **Report Content Creation:**
    - Structure execution results, deliverables, and self-evaluation, integrate with checklist from `{{received_context}}`, and internally create report content (framework of `{{handover_context}}`).
        - **Direction:** (Task goal re-confirmation or final direction of completed tasks)
        - **Context:** Overview of executed Markdown editing tasks (target files, major changes, etc.).
        - **Significance & Priority:** (Describe if there are noteworthy matters)
        - **Relationships & Dependencies:** (Describe if there are noteworthy matters)
        - **Abstraction Level:** (Describe if there are noteworthy matters)
        - **Execution & Evaluation:** Execution status (success), deliverables (file paths, Lint results, etc.), self-evaluation (quality, style guide adherence, instruction adherence, etc.).
4. **Caller Judgment and Processing Branch:**
    - **When `{{prev_cell}}` is `03_a_task_manager`:**
        - Set report content created in Step 3 to `{{handover_context}}`.
        - State transition declaration: "Reporting results to `{{prev_cell}}` and ending processing."
    - **Other cases:**
        - Present report content created in Step 3 to users.
        - **State Transition Declaration: End (TIDE Step 4):**
            - Make the following declaration:
              "This concludes the role of `{{this_cell}}`. Subsequent responses will be handled by `{{prev_cell}}`."
        - **Next Cell Rule Application (TIDE Step 5):**
            - If `01_orchestrator` is `{{prev_cell}}`, do not use `fetch_rules`; for other `{{prev_cell}}` cases, use `fetch_rules` tool to retrieve and apply rule files for `{{prev_cell}}` and immediately begin processing of `{{prev_cell}}`.

### Stage 3c-e (error)

**Purpose:** Respond to errors that occurred during execution and perform self-correction, plan review requests (TIDE application), or user consultation.

1. **Problem Detection:** Detect errors during processing.
2. **Cause Analysis:** Infer causes if possible.
3. **Response Judgment:**
    - **Self-Correction:** Attempt simple problems (e.g., `reapply`). If successful, return to original Stage.
    - **Plan Review Request (Handover via TIDE):** When problems with the plan itself are suspected. Or when failure of any step is judged to have significant impact on executability of subsequent steps or overall plan achievement.
    - Proceed to `Stage 3c-f`.
    - **User Reporting:** When all above are considered insufficient, report to users.

### Stage 3c-f (handover)

**Purpose:** Integrate and structure overall dialogue results and hand over to `{{next_cell}}` as `{{handover_context}}`.

1. **Transition Trigger/Judgment (TIDE Step 1):** Begin transition only when plan review request is selected in `Stage 3c-e`.
2. **Next Cell Identification (TIDE Step 2):**
    - **When `{{prev_cell}}` is `03_a_task_manager`:**
        - Specify `03_a_task_manager` as `{{next_cell}}`.
    - **Other cases:**
        - Specify `02_planner` as `{{next_cell}}`.
3. **Inherited Context Specification (TIDE Step 3):**
    - Set as `{{handover_context}}` "truly necessary information" considering the 6-item inherited context so that `{{next_cell}}` can effectively fulfill its responsibilities (problem analysis, re-planning, etc.).
        - **Direction:** Direction seeking re-planning or solutions (e.g., "Request cause analysis and plan correction due to error during Markdown editing task execution").
        - **Context:** Stage where error occurred (e.g., `Stage 3c-b Lint execution`), error messages, related file paths.
        - **Significance & Priority:** Problem importance, impact on overall task or subsequent processing.
        - **Relationships & Dependencies:** (Describe dependency information useful for error analysis if any)
        - **Abstraction Level:** (Describe if there are noteworthy points about problem reporting granularity)
        - **Execution & Evaluation:** Execution status (failure), attempted self-repair and its results, initial error analysis results.
4. **State Transition Declaration: End (TIDE Step 4):**
    - Make the following declaration:
      "This concludes the role of `{{this_cell}}`. Subsequent responses will be handled by `{{next_cell}}`."
5. **Next Cell Rule Application (TIDE Step 5):**
    - Use `fetch_rules` tool to retrieve and apply rule files for `{{next_cell}}`, and immediately begin processing of `{{next_cell}}`.
